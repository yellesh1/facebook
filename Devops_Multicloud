4) What is the architecture of software project (layers)

5) Tech Stack of software project

====================
Q) Software Project 
====================

=> Collection of software programs is called as Software Project.

=> To develop software programs we will use programming languages.

        Ex: C, C++, Java, Python, C# DOT Net...

==========================================
Q) Why to develop software project ?
==========================================        

=> Software projects are used to reduce human efforts and simplify humans life.

============================

1) Desktop applications / Stand-Alone applications

2) Web Applications

3) Mobile Applications  


=> Desktop applications will execute only in one system. Only one user can access at a time.

Ex : OS, Calculator, Hospital Billing s/w, Super Market Billing s/w ...


=> Web Applications can be accessed by multiple users at a time with internet.

Ex: gmail, youtube, linkedin, facebook, ashokit

=> Mobile applications are used to run in mobiles   

Ex : whatsapp, instagram app, fb messenger, flipkart app, amazon app

================================

    ## Backend Technologies : Java, Python, DOT Net, Node JS, PHP...

=> Database is used to store the data permanently.

    Ex: Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostGres, Mongo DB...

========================
Application Tech Stack  
========================

App-1 : Angular + Java + Oracle

App-2 : React JS + Java + Mongo DB

App-3 : Angular + Python + MySQL
